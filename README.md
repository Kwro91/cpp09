## About the project
This project is the `CPP 09` learning module of 42 School.
All the C++ modules are based on C++98.

This project focuses on  : `Algorithm & Containers`.

[Containers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/containers-cpp-stl/) are used to store elements in a way to making it easier & improve the flexibility. Few examples of `Vector`, `Map` & `List`.

[Iterator]("https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_iterators.asp") are used as a pointer to parse the containers. For example, begin() or end() are functions belonging to data structures (vector,list...) and they return an iterator.

## Exercices
